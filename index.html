            <h2>Texas</h2>
                <p>
                    It's no secret that Texans like to brag. But the saying "everything is bigger in Texas" doesn't just refer to big hats, 
                    big hair, and big attitudes. It has its roots in the state's enormous geographical area. Texas has a total area of 268,820 
                    square miles (696,241 km²), ranking just behind Alaska in terms of size. But Texas has over 60 times the population of Alaska! 
                    According to the 2020 Census Bureau, there are approximately 29 million people in Texas. Texas is second only to California 
                    in terms of population, with three cities—Dallas, Houston, and San Antonio—among the top ten most populous in the United States. 
                    The Texas economy is one of the largest in the world, equal to that of the nation of India.
